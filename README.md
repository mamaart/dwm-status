# üìà Statusbar for DWM

dwm-status is a statusbar for dwm, written in golang. 

The state of the bar can be modified in runtime over http. For instance show date instead of time or toggle text stream.

The bar can show some standard information about the computer, but it also has an infinite rolling text field which is used to show answers from LLM
